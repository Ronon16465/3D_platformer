CSE 423 Group Project 

Project Title: Blorp 3D — A Low-Poly 3D Platformer

Introduction

Blorp 3D is a simple 3D (2.5D) platformer game built using OpenGL functions. The game focuses on player movement, jumping mechanics, and interactive environments such as moving platforms, hazards, and collectibles.

Objectives

 1. Create a 3D platformer world using cubes and primitive shapes.
 2. Implement smooth player controls including running, jumping, double jumping, and dashing.
 3. Add interactive elements such as moving platforms, spikes, and enemies.
 4. Include collectibles like power ups.
 5. Design a win condition by reaching a goal.
